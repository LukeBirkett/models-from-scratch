https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmbA0pi2cRQ

- Has an seciton on both maths and codes
- Code side is easy to follow
- Maths highlighted that I need a more verbose explanation
- Uses Pandas and no Numpy

- Full breakdown of mathematical theory including Gradient Descent algo
- Coding uses  only Numpy, no pandas (good)
- Implementation arrears to take a more Linear Algebra and Matrix approach
- Uses gradient descent as optimization algo
- I have implemented coding approach along with stepwise notes on understanding

Gradient Descent, Step-by-Step by Joshua Stramer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDv4f4s2SB8

- This video helped me understand that gradient works as an omptimzation 
  method by converting the problem to identifying the minimum
- You can use the cost function to create an inverted bell curve 
- We want to find the cost function at the bottom of the bell curve
- If you take the derivative of cost function on bell curve you get the slope
- The slope at the bottom of the curve is zero
- Gradient descent iterates to until we are close to 0 (<0.09)
- I need to implement the concept of this video into code to ensure I had
  understood correctly
- Implement in a neat notebook with latex etc

- Full breakdown of mathematical theory including Gradient Descent algo
- Coding uses  only Numpy, no pandas (good)
- Implementation arrears to take a more Linear Algebra and Matrix approach
- Uses gradient descent as optimization algo
- I have implemented coding approach along with stepwise notes on understanding
